# Hi there! 👋

I'm Saddam, a Computer Science graduate with a master degree from Virtual University of Pakistan. I have a passion for coding, especially in Python and Django.

## Final Year Project

For my university's Final Year Project, I created a web application for data scraping. It extracted product data from e-commerce websites like Amazon and Daraz, presenting it on a user-friendly webpage. This project honed my skills in web development and data management, offering hands-on experience with web scraping techniques.

## Work Experience

### Transdata Software House

I've been working at Transdev Software House, where I make sure our software works perfectly by testing it thoroughly. Our projects span various domains, with a significant focus on AI-related applications.

- Document Automation AI Software
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) AI Software
- Tax Certificate Generator React Web Application

My role entails ensuring that these software solutions meet the highest standards of quality and functionality, contributing to the success of our innovative projects.

## Passion for Coding

Besides testing, I've also worked on numerous web development projects. Coding is not just a job for me; it's like a best friend I love spending time with.

I'm always eager to learn more about coding. It's like a puzzle that I can't wait to solve every day. I believe technology has the power to change the world, and I want to be a part of that change.
